## Installation

### Option 1: Using `pi install` (Recommended)

Install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pi install https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-makora-provider
```

Then set your API key and run pi:
```bash
# Recommended: add to auth.json
# See Authentication section below

# Or set as environment variable
export MAKORA_OPTIMIZE_TOKEN=your-api-key-here

pi
```

### Option 2: Manual Clone

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-makora-provider.git
   cd pi-makora-provider
   ```

2. Set your Makora API key:
   ```bash
   # Recommended: add to auth.json
   # See Authentication section below

   # Or set as environment variable
   export MAKORA_OPTIMIZE_TOKEN=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. Run pi with the extension:
   ```bash
   pi -e /path/to/pi-makora-provider
   ```

## Setup

### API Key

Add your Makora API key to `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` (recommended):

```json
{
  "makora": { "type": "api_key", "key": "your-api-key" }
}
```

Or set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export MAKORA_OPTIMIZE_TOKEN=your-api-key
```

### Usage

```bash
pi -e /path/to/pi-makora-provider
```

Then use `/model` to select from available Makora models.

## Model Resolution

Makora does not expose a `/v1/models` endpoint, so models are statically defined in `models.json`. Custom definitions can be added via `custom-models.json`.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `models.json` | Curated model definitions with per-model `baseUrl` overrides (each model lives at `https://inference.makora.com/{slug}/v1`) |
| `custom-models.json` | User-added models not in the embedded list |

Models are loaded by merging `models.json` with `custom-models.json`.

## Adding Custom Models

To change existing models, edit `models.json` directly. To add new models without modifying the curated list, add entries to `custom-models.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "my-org/my-model",
    "name": "My Custom Model",
    "reasoning": false,
    "input": ["text"],
    "cost": { "input": 0, "output": 0, "cacheRead": 0, "cacheWrite": 0 },
    "contextWindow": 131072,
    "maxTokens": 16384,
    "baseUrl": "https://inference.makora.com/my-model-slug/v1"
  }
]
```

## API Notes

- Each model is accessible at its own URL slug: `https://inference.makora.com/{slug}/v1/chat/completions`
- The API is OpenAI-compatible (chat completions format)
- No `/v1/models` endpoint is available; models must be manually maintained
- All models are hosted on vLLM
- The `developer` role is not supported (prompts are silently dropped); `supportsDeveloperRole` is set to `false` for all models

## vLLM Caveats

These issues are common to all vLLM-hosted providers and affect Makora models:

- **GLM 5.1 tool calling**: vLLM's streaming tool call handling is broken for GLM — the model outputs Zhipu's native `<tool_call>` XML format as raw text. The `message_end` hook parses this into `toolCall` blocks so pi can execute the tools. A `context` hook then strips `tool_calls` from assistant messages before follow-up requests, converting them back to `<tool_call>` text to avoid a ZAI/vLLM server crash (500: `'str object' has no attribute 'items'`) that occurs when any assistant message contains a `tool_calls` field. If upstream fixes both the streaming parser and the 500 crash, the `message_end` hook gracefully skips (existing valid `toolCall` blocks are preserved), and the `context` hook's text-stripping is harmless (GLM natively understands `<tool_call>` format in conversation history).

  - **Kimi K2.6 + Qwen 3.6 tool calling**: vLLM's streaming tool call handling is broken or missing for these models. The `before_provider_request` hook sets `tool_choice: "none"` and `skip_special_tokens: false` so the model's tool call tokens pass through as plain text. The `message_end` hook then re-parses into `toolCall` blocks:

    - **Kimi K2.6**: Uses `<|tool_call_begin|>...<|tool_call_end|>` tokens. Makora's vLLM is missing both `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and `--tool-call-parser` for this model.
    - **Qwen 3.6**: Uses hermes-style `<function=...>` XML, sometimes with `█` delimiters. Same vLLM flag limitation as Kimi.

- **GLM 5.1 CoT leak**: On some vLLM builds, disabling reasoning may still leak chain-of-thought into `content` terminated by a ``` marker. See [vllm-project/vllm#31319](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/31319).

- **DeepSeek V4 reasoning**: The current vLLM deployment does not support DeepSeek V4 reasoning mode. `reasoning_content` is always null even when `thinking` is enabled. Both DeepSeek V4 models are registered as `reasoning: false`.
